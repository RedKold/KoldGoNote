- BFS structure
```python
Bfs(G,s)
	Mark s as “discovered”;
	enqueue(pending,s);
	while (pending is nonempty)
		v=front(pending);
		dequeue(pending, v);
		For each vertex w that edge vw is in G:
			If w is “undiscovered”
			Mark w as “discovered” and enqueue(pending, w)
		Mark v as “finished”;
```
- DFS structure
```python
dfs(G,v)
	Mark v as “discovered”.
	For each vertex w that edge vw is in G:
		If w is undiscovered:
			dfs(G,w)
		Otherwise:
			“Check” vw without visiting w.
	Mark v as “finished”.
```
